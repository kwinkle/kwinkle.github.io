                    		<p> My research interests are driven by an overall ambition to ensure robots have a positive impact when deployed into real world environments, with a focus on human-robot interaction. I look to achieve this by:</p>
                    		<p> (i) pursuing domain expert-led robot development through co-design studies and human-in-the-loop automation methods </p>
                    		<p> (ii) undertaking human-robot interaction studies examining what makes for ``effective'' human-robot interaction, but also the ethical risks (and opportunities) posed by such, e.g. considering robots can influence those people around them </p>  
                    		<p> <a href="https://play.umu.se/media/t/0_j9zk6y5f/411923"> This talk </a> I gave at Umeå University in February 2022 gives a good overview of what I'm up to. </p>

                        	<h2>Creating Socially Assistive Robots for the Real World</h2>
                    		<p> My research interests are driven by an overall ambition to create autonomous, engaging, socially assistive robots that are effective in the real world. Technically, this means developing robots that can 'read' a complex social situation and act accordingly - e.g. knowing when to challenge you versus when to back off, or even tell a joke. However, it also means thinking about acceptability - robots have got to be <i> used </i> if they're going to be <i> useful; </i> and this is reflected in my choice of design/automation methodologies and the user studies I run. </p>

							<h2>Working with Domain Experts</h2>
							<p> Human-human interaction is vital in socially assistive scenarios like healthcare and education, and I want to create robots that support and augment those interactions rather try to replicate or replace them. In addition, it seems obvious that we should try to maximise the fantastic skillset of (non-roboticist) domain experts like therapists and teachers. So, I work to include these experts at every stage of the robot design and development process, whether through participatory design sessions like workshops and focus groups or through novel machine learning approaches that allow non-roboticists to <i> teach </i> robots what to do directly. </p>

							<h2>Mutual Shaping</h2>
							<p> Again thinking about building robots that are effective in the <i> real world </i> it's important to recognise that deployment and use of a robot impacts on and is impacted on <i> by </i> the surrounding social environment. This can positive or negative, for example deployment of a robot might generate new, valuable interactions between people that wouldn't have otherwise happened, or have the opposite effect of preventing a vital interaction that <i> should </i> have happened. I take a mutual shaping approach in my work that recognises this two-way interaction between a robot and its broader environment, e.g. by conducting ethnographic studies of robots deployed 'in-the-wild'. </p>

							<h2>Robots and Social Influence</h2>
							<p> For a 5 minute introduction to this topic, <a href="roboidentity.mp4"> see this talk </a> I gave at the Robo-Identity workshop held at HRI 2021. The associated workshop paper, which gives good hints towards some of my future research directions, can be found <a href="roboidentity21.pdf"> here </a>.</p>
							<p> Current research projects: </p>
							<p> Reflecting on e.g. how robot social influence and the intentional design of robot identity performances might be used to challenge gender norms for an actively feminist HRI design stance [3,4]  </p> 
							<p> Previous research projects: </p>
							<p> Examining the potential tension between ethics and effectiveness on anthropomorphism in socially assistive robots [5] </p>
							<p> Investigating whether social persuasion strategies used by e.g. therapists will also increase how much exercise people are willing to do with a social robot [6] </p>

							<h2>Additional Projects and Collaborations</h2>
							<p> PhD student <a href="https://www.jku.at/lit-robopsychology-lab/ueber-uns/team/laura-moradbakhti/">Laura Moradbakhti</a> from Linz Institute of Technology came and spent a few weeks with us at Uppsala in February 2022. We're working together on a study examining the potential impacts of robot gender and agency on the basic psychological needs of informal caregivers, formal caregivers and care receivers. </p>
							<p> For almost a year now I've been working with Erik Lagerstedt, Ilaria Torre and Anna Offenwanger on a "side project" which started as an attempt to replicate Anna's 2021 CHI paper on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445383">gender bias in HCI research participation</a> but has grown to include a more intersectional analysis of who is taking part <i> and </i> who is doing HRI. A short description is available in our <a href="DEI22.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/nEV3D3_nIA4"> video presentation</a>) for the DEI workshop at HRI 2022</p>
