                    		<p> My research interests are driven by an overall ambition to create engaging and useful socially assistive robots that have a positive impact when deployed into real world environments. I look to achieve this by:</p>
                    		<p> (i) pursuing domain expert-led robot development through co-design studies and human-in-the-loop automation methods </p>
                    		<p> (ii) assessing and addressing the ethical risks posed by human robot interaction, specifically considering how social robots can influence those people around them </p>

                        	<h2>Creating Socially Assistive Robots for the Real World</h2>
                    		<p> My research interests are driven by an overall ambition to create autonomous, engaging, socially assistive robots that are effective in the real world. Technically, this means developing robots that can 'read' a complex social situation and act accordingly - e.g. knowing when to challenge you versus when to back off, or even tell a joke. However, it also means thinking about acceptability - robots have got to be <i> used </i> if they're going to be <i> useful; </i> and this is reflected in my choice of design/automation methodologies and the user studies I run. </p>

							<h2>Working with Domain Experts</h2>
							<p> Human-human interaction is vital in socially assistive scenarios like healthcare and education, and I want to create robots that support and augment those interactions rather try to replicate or replace them. In addition, it seems obvious that we should try to maximise the fantastic skillset of (non-roboticist) domain experts like therapists and teachers. So, I work to include these experts at every stage of the robot design and development process, whether through participatory design sessions like workshops and focus groups or through novel machine learning approaches that allow non-roboticists to <i> teach </i> robots what to do directly. </p>

							<h2>Mutual Shaping</h2>
							<p> Again thinking about building robots that are effective in the <i> real world </i> it's important to recognise that deployment and use of a robot impacts on and is impacted on <i> by </i> the surrounding social environment. This can positive or negative, for example deployment of a robot might generate new, valuable interactions between people that wouldn't have otherwise happened, or have the opposite effect of preventing a vital interaction that <i> should </i> have happened. I take a mutual shaping approach in my work that recognises this two-way interaction between a robot and its broader environment, e.g. by conducting ethnographic studies of robots deployed 'in-the-wild'. </p>

							<h2>Robots and Social Influence</h2>
							<p> For a 5 minute introduction to this topic, <a href="roboidentity.mp4"> see this talk </a> I gave at the Robo-Identity workshop held at HRI 2021. The associated workshop paper, which hints at my ongoing collaborations with <a href="https://mirrorlab.mines.edu/"> Tom Williams</a> can be found <a href="roboidentity21.pdf"> here </a>.</p>
							<p> Current research projects: </p>
							<p> Reflecting on e.g. how robot social influence and the intentional design of robot identity performances might be used to challenge gender norms for an actively feminist HRI design stance [3,4]  </p> 
							<p> Previous research projects: </p>
							<p> Examining the potential tension between ethics and effectiveness on anthropomorphism in socially assistive robots [5] </p>
							<p> Investigating whether social persuasion strategies used by e.g. therapists will also increase how much exercise people are willing to do with a social robot [6] </p>
